      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Criminal Justice Administrative Records System (CJARS) at the University of Michigan. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Houston in 2020. I am primarily interested in Applied Microeconomics with a focus on labor economics, public economics, and economics of crime. My current research is focused on identifying and measuring racial bias in law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;not-so-black-and-white-uncovering-racial-bias-from-systematically-misrecorded-trooper-reports&#34;&gt;Not so Black and White: Uncovering Racial Bias from Systematically Misrecorded Trooper Reports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement officers may purposely misrecord the race of citizens that they interact with in order to evade detection of racial bias. Using a unique event in Texas where Texas troopers were caught intentionally misrecording minority motorists as white, I propose a new test of racial bias in the presence of misrecording that is well-suited to explore the rich heterogeneity in bias behavior. By measuring the different misrecording rates across search outcome, I find bias against all minority motorists, but the most against Hispanic motorists. I disaggregate the bias to the individual trooper level and find that nearly 60\% of troopers were engaging in this behavior. Using my trooper-level measure of bias, I can identify causal relationships between bias and labor outcomes using a panel data of trooper employment outcomes and comparing employment outcomes to bias after the misrecording was revealed by the media in 2015. I find that this rule change was effective in curbing lying behavior in troopers and in reducing bias against Hispanic motorists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;racial-bias-in-parking-tickets-and-the-long-term-effects-of-bias&#34;&gt;Racial Bias in Parking Tickets and the Long Term effects of Bias&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biased application of parking laws may have greater detrimental effects on neighborhoods than previously estimated. Using an exogeneous increase in the fine for vehicle registration in Chicago enacted in 2017, I am able to test and measure racial bias in parking enforcement. I find that the increase in fines in black neighborhoods led to a 5% increase in driver&amp;rsquo;s license suspension, a 1% increase in bankruptcy declarations, and 10% increase in policing compared to white neighborhoods before and after the fine increase.&lt;/p&gt;
